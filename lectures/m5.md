In this week we will cover object composition. 

Recall that interfaces and classes use the subtype or "is-a" relationship. Give me an example. 

Now we talk about the composition or `part-of` relationship. E.g., an arm is part of a body. COmposition is important for assembling large wholes out of smaller pieces. 

For example, a Team aggregates Players, from whom it aggregates the ability for keeping track of points. The Team's points are then just a sum of the individual player points. 

# Sequence Diagrams
We walked through the sequence diagram in the text, and then did an exercise in creating a sequence diagram for the assignment. We first identifed the relevant use cases we might want to design/document - startup, normal operations, shutdown.

Remember that this only shows one execution, and that as usual unnecessary details should be left out. 

# Composite Pattern
**groups of objects behave like single objects**
A good way to think about what we are trying to do here is the distinction between folders and files in the file system. When we do `ls` we really don't differentiate between them, *except* that folders have a containment themselves.

We have some sample code illustrating this. We want to run a movie theatre. It has `Show`s. Those shows, though, could be a number of actual things. It could be a simple movie, or a series of movies (a double bill). 

Here's how we represent that in the class diagram. And here is some code.

Client - `Program`
Primitive - `Movie, DoubleBill, Null`
Interface - `Show`
Composite - `CompositeShow`

## The Null Object Pattern
When we traverse (say) a file system, i.e., a Composite pattern, some of our objects may be empty, e.g. a folder with no children. We could check to see if the references are null (e.g. a BinaryTree node with no children), but that requires a separate check. A `null object` means we no longer have to think about this aspect, and can do a `no-op` with the null object.

# Class discussion on patterns
- who has done a co-op in industry?
- how Gradle works with Eclipse
    - the standard, Java 1.2 approach to compiling and running code
    - the Eclipse way
    - Gradle (and Maven, Ant, etc)

# Using Logging
What do we want to log?
    - what would you like to see when debugging a crashed application?
    - consider the case where you don't get access to the stack trace, e.g. running on a hosted instance
    - tradeoff performance for debuggability - log files get very large, very quickly. Examples of servers crashing because log files consumed all disk space.
    - log "levels": ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE

Why log vs say sout?
    - turn logs on or off as needed (e.g. with --warn flag)
    - more metadata, object information
    - different `Appender`s allow for different destinations

## Using [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html)
- a meta package wrapping various logging frameworks, most popularly 
- we are using the simpleLog - as it says, very simple. 
- overwrites file each run
- log level set on startup

# Checkstyle config
- download the [Google style XML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml) file
- see [here as well](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse)
- Eclipse: Window/Preferences select Java/Code Style/Formatter. Import the settings file by selecting Import.
- Turn Checkstyle on for this project: right click project, Properties, Checkstyle, `Checkstyle active for this project`

# Decorator Pattern
## Design Problem
You need to implement a point-of-sale system for a coffee shop. The coffee shop has some basic beverages, but customers can customize their drinks by choosing what kind of milk they want, if they want flavoured syrup, etc.

You could create a class for each drink, but there are so many possible combinations that the number of classes would quickly get out of hand. 

## Decorator Pattern
Name: Decorator
Intent: Attach additional *responsibilities* to an object dynamically
Participants & Structure:

## Decorator explained
![](img/hfdp-dec.png)

## Decorator Concepts
- Decorators should be of the primitive type. This allows for Decorator chaining
- implement the primitive type, and delegate that method to the decorated object (e.g. draw(), cost(), etc.)
- decorate the same object

## Java Library Example
<!-- file input - buffering, unarchive, encode etc -->

<code>BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File("a.txt")));</code>
